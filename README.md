# 🚗 License Plate Recognition using Neural Networks & Computer Vision

This repository contains resources and code for a project on automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

## ✅ Features

* 📥 Data preprocessing and augmentation for license plate images
* 🎯 Detection and localization of license plates from raw images
* 🤖 Neural network model training and evaluation
* 🔍 Visualization of model performance and predictions
* 📝 Detailed computer vision report in PDF format

## 📚 Overview

The project demonstrates the complete pipeline for recognizing license plates using a convolutional neural network-based approach. It includes preprocessing images, building and training models, saving model architecture (`model_LicensePlateRec.json`) and weights (`model_LicensePlateRec.h5`), and producing a comprehensive report (`cv_report.pdf`).

## 🔬 Process

1️⃣ Load and preprocess dataset of vehicle images.

2️⃣ Train CNN model to detect and classify license plates.

3️⃣ Evaluate model using accuracy, loss plots, and prediction visualizations.

4️⃣ Save trained model architecture and weights for future deployment.

## 📦 Files Included

* `license_plate_rec.ipynb`: Full Jupyter Notebook with code, experiments, and results.
* `model_LicensePlateRec.h5`: Trained model weights.
* `model_LicensePlateRec.json`: Model architecture.
* `cv_report.pdf`: Project report with detailed analysis, methodology, and findings.

Open the notebook to explore the entire workflow — from raw data to model deployment-ready files!
